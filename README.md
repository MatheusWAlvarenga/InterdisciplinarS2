# Numerical Base Converter

This interdisciplinary project, part of the 2nd semester of the Computer Science course, utilizes knowledge in programming, logic, computer organization and architecture, as well as discrete mathematics. The goal is to develop a Java-based numerical base converter calculator, allowing users to convert values between different bases, such as decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal, or other user-defined bases.

## Features

- Conversion between different numerical bases: decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal, or other user-defined bases.
- Step-by-step conversion display: the system should provide a step-by-step display of the conversion process, helping users understand the transformation between bases.
- Input error handling: the system should handle invalid input, such as disallowed characters for the selected base.

## Technical Requirements

To run the project, you need to have the Java development environment set up. You will need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- A code editor or Java IDE, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository to your computer or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the main file, usually named `Main.java` or similar.
4. Follow the instructions displayed in the console to interact with the numerical base converter calculator.
5. Experiment with different values and bases to perform the desired conversions.
6. Observe the step-by-step process shown during the conversion to understand the process.

## Contribution

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment, and therefore, additional contributions are not expected at this time.
